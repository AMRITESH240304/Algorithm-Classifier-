# SVM Classifier and Linear Regression
1) The project contains code for a simple machine learning project, which classifies Iris flowers using the Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithm. The project uses the Iris dataset
2) This project implements a linear regression model to predict capita based on year for a given data set. It demonstrates the use of scikit-learn's linear_model module and the calculation of model score, mean squared error.

# Model scores of SVM

Accuracy :- 93%

Mean absolute error :- 0.06

# Model scores of Linear Regression

Accuracy :- 83%

Mean squared error:- 14622278.77
